## Summary

Axiomatic is a GitHub webhook handler that launches [dir2consul](https://github.com/code42/dir2consul) as a Nomad batch job.

## Configuration

Axiomatic uses environment variables to override the default configuration values. The Nomad job definition for the Axiomatic service should be adjusted to set these variables.

* AXIOMATIC_GITHUB_SECRET (**required**) is the secret token for validating webhook requests. There is no default value, only sorrow.
* AXIOMATIC_IP is the IP address to bind. Default = 127.0.0.1
* AXIOMATIC_PORT is the port number to bind. Default = 8181
* AXIOMATIC_SSH_PRIV_KEY (**required**) is the private ssh key used for cloning repositories. It must be base64 encoded.
* AXIOMATIC_SSH_PUB_KEY (**required**) is the public ssh key used for cloning repositories.
* NOMAD_ADDR is the address of the Nomad server. Default = http://127.0.0.1:4646
* NOMAD_CACERT is the path to a PEM encoded CA cert file to use to verify the Nomad server SSL certificate.
* NOMAD_CAPATH is the path to a directory of PEM encoded CA cert files to verify the Nomad server SSL certificate.
* NOMAD_CLIENT_CERT Path to a PEM encoded client certificate for TLS authentication to the Nomad server.
* NOMAD_CLIENT_KEY Path to an unencrypted PEM encoded private key matching the client certificate.
* NOMAD_NAMESPACE is the target namespace for queries and actions. Default = "default"
* NOMAD_REGION is region of the Nomad servers to forward commands.
* NOMAD_TOKEN is the SecretID of an ACL token to use to authenticate API requests.

Axiomatic passes environment variables, beginning with "CONSUL_" or "D2C_", through to dir2consul. This provides a convenient way to configure the dir2consul batch jobs launched by Axiomatic.

## Installation

Axiomatic requires no installation. It ships as a Docker container meant for running as a service.

### Run the service on Nomad

```bash
#> nomad job plan axiomatic.nomad
#> nomad job run -check-index 0 axiomatic.nomad
```

### Setup the GitHub Repo Webhook and SSH Key

1. Open the Settings tab for your repo and choose "Deploy keys" in the menu
1. Add the ssh public key as a repository deploy key
1. Open the Settings tab for your repo and choose "Webhooks" in the menu

Service health can be confirmed by making a web request to the '/health' path of the service.
